### What I learned

In this project I felt the importance of a good structured HTML page, in order to better understand and also style the content to be rendered.
The class name giving is also important, since as the projects develops, is crucial to understand what are the elements that need be to target, in order to restyle or restructure them along the way.
The use of Flexbox again, shown to be crucial.
